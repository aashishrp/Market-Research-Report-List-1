<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Negative Electron Beam Resists Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Contrast（> 5）</li><li>Low Contrast（< 5）</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Negative Electron Beam Resists (NEBR) are materials used in electron beam lithography for micro- and nano-patterning processes. The market for NEBR can be categorized into two types based on their contrast level. High Contrast NEBR (> 5) exhibits a significant difference in electron beam sensitivity between exposed and unexposed areas, allowing for precise patterning with clear distinction. On the other hand, Low Contrast NEBR (< 5) offers a lower differentiation between exposed and unexposed regions, compromising the overall resolution and precision of the patterning process. These differences in contrast levels determine the application suitability and performance of NEBR in electron beam lithography.</p></p>
