<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Three axis Gyroscope Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Interferometric Gyroscope</li><li>Resonant Gyroscope</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The interferometric gyroscope is a type of three-axis gyroscope that utilizes the principle of interference to measure rotational angles. It consists of two beams of light traveling in opposite directions, and any rotation will cause the phase shift in the beams, enabling accurate measurement. On the other hand, the resonant gyroscope utilizes the concept of mechanical resonance to detect rotation. It consists of a vibrating structure, and any rotation will result in a change in the resonant frequency, allowing precise determination of the rotation. Both types are commonly used in navigation systems and other applications requiring accurate rotation sensing.</p></p>
