<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Construction Paints and Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-based</li><li>Solvent-based</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Construction paints and coatings market can be classified into water-based and solvent-based types. Water-based paints are made from water as the main solvent, making them environmentally friendly and low in volatile organic compounds (VOCs). They dry faster, emit fewer odors, and are easy to clean up. Solvent-based paints, on the other hand, use organic solvents as the main solvent. Although they dry slower, they offer better adhesion, durability, and resistance to chemicals and weathering. However, they release higher levels of VOCs and have stricter environmental regulations.</p></p>
