<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aluminum Catalyst Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Activated</li><li>Non-activated</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Aluminum Catalyst market includes two main types: Activated and Non-activated catalysts. Activated catalysts are those which have gone through a process to enhance their reactivity and surface area, resulting in a higher catalytic activity. They are widely used in various industries like petrochemical, automotive, and pharmaceuticals. On the other hand, Non-activated catalysts are not subjected to any specific treatment or modification, and therefore have lower catalytic activity. They find limited applications where high reactivity is not a requisite. Both types play a significant role in different catalytic processes depending on the desired reaction efficiency.</p></p>
