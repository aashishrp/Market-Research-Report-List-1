<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Curtain Wall Adhesive Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Acidic Adhesive</li><li>Neutral Adhesive</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Curtain wall adhesive is categorized into two market types: acidic adhesive and neutral adhesive. Acidic adhesive is made from materials that contain acidic compounds. It offers strong adhesion and fast curing properties. However, it can cause corrosion on certain surfaces. On the other hand, neutral adhesive is formulated without acidic compounds, making it less likely to cause corrosion. It provides good adhesion and a longer curing time, making it suitable for various applications in curtain wall installations. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring secure and long-lasting bondings in curtain wall systems.</p></p>
