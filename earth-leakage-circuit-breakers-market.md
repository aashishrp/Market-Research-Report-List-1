<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Earth Leakage Circuit Breakers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Voltage Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (VELCB)</li><li>Current Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (CELCB)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Earth Leakage Circuit Breakers Market comprises two main types: Voltage Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (VELCB) and Current Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (CELCB). VELCBs are designed to detect voltage leakages in electrical systems and automatically cut off the power supply when leakage is detected. On the other hand, CELCBs monitor the current flowing through the circuit and trip the breaker if there is a significant difference between the incoming and outgoing currents. Both types play a crucial role in preventing electrical shocks and protecting electrical equipment from damage.</p></p>
