<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cover Tape for Semiconductor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heat Activated Type</li><li>Pressure Sensitive Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cover tape is used in semiconductor packaging to protect the components during transportation and handling. There are two types of cover tape in the market. The heat activated type requires heat to create a strong bond between the tape and the carrier tape, ensuring the components remain securely enclosed. On the other hand, the pressure sensitive type forms a bond through pressure application, eliminating the need for heat. Both types serve the same purpose of protecting semiconductors, but differ in the method of adhesion.</p></p>
