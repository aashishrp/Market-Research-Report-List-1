<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Foam Control Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>De-foaming Agent</li><li>Anti-foaming Agent</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Foam control agents are used to prevent or eliminate foam formation in various industrial processes. De-foaming agents are substances that help in reducing or removing existing foam, while anti-foaming agents are used to prevent foam formation altogether. Both types of agents are vital in industries such as food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, paints and coatings, and wastewater treatment. De-foaming agents work by breaking down bubbles and reducing surface tension, while anti-foaming agents prevent foam formation by reducing the ability of liquids to trap air.</p></p>
