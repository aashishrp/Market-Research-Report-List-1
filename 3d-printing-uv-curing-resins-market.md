<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3D Printing UV-curing Resins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Free Radical Type</li><li>Cationic Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The 3D Printing UV-curing Resins market consists of two main types: Free Radical Type and Cationic Type. Free Radical Type resins utilize a photoinitiator that generates free radicals upon exposure to UV light, leading to a polymerization reaction. This type is widely used due to its versatility and fast curing time. On the other hand, Cationic Type resins utilize a different photoinitiator that generates cations instead of free radicals, resulting in a slower and more controlled curing process. This type is preferred for heat-sensitive materials or applications requiring high resolution.</p></p>
