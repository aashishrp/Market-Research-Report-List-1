<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peltier Thermoelectric Cooler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Stage Module</li><li>Multi Stage Module</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Peltier thermoelectric cooler market can be divided into two types: single-stage module and multi-stage module. Single-stage modules are designed to generate a temperature difference between two surfaces by using one thermoelectric couple. They are simpler and less expensive than multi-stage modules but have lower cooling capacity. On the other hand, multi-stage modules consist of multiple thermoelectric couples connected in series, allowing them to achieve a higher temperature difference and providing better cooling performance. However, they are more complex and costly compared to single-stage modules.</p></p>
