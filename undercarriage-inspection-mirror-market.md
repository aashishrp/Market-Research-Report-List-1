<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Undercarriage Inspection Mirror Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plane Mirror</li><li>Convex Mirror</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The undercarriage inspection mirror market consists of two primary types: plane mirror and convex mirror. A plane mirror is a flat mirror that provides a clear and accurate reflection of the undercarriage, enabling inspectors to identify any damages or issues easily. On the other hand, a convex mirror is curved outward, allowing for a wider viewing angle of the undercarriage. This type of mirror is beneficial in detecting larger areas and provides a distorted reflection. Both mirror types are crucial in undercarriage inspection, providing different advantages depending on the observer's needs.</p></p>
