<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plastic Polymer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic Polymers</li><li>Thermosetting Polymers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Plastic polymer market types can be categorized into two main groups; thermoplastic polymers and thermosetting polymers. Thermoplastic polymers are materials that can be melted and re-molded multiple times without undergoing significant changes in their chemical structure. They offer versatility, easy processing, and recycling capabilities. On the other hand, thermosetting polymers are materials that undergo irreversible chemical reactions when heated, resulting in a hardened and rigid structure. These polymers offer exceptional heat resistance and mechanical properties but cannot be re-melted or re-molded once they are set.</p></p>
