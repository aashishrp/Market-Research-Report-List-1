<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Titanium Slag Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Acid Soluble Slag</li><li>Chlorination Slag</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Titanium slag is a valuable byproduct of titanium dioxide production. The market for titanium slag is divided into two types: acid soluble slag and chlorination slag. Acid soluble slag is produced by treating ilmenite ore with sulfuric acid, resulting in a material that can be dissolved in acid. This type of slag is mainly used in the production of titanium dioxide pigment. On the other hand, chlorination slag is obtained by subjecting ilmenite ore to chlorination process, resulting in a material that is primarily used in the production of titanium metal and titanium sponge.</p></p>
