<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Luminous Paints Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radioactive Substance</li><li>Light-Charged Substance</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Luminous paints, also known as glow-in-the-dark paints, are available in two different market types: radioactive substance and light-charged substance. Radioactive substance luminous paints contain radioactive elements that emit radiation, which excites the phosphors in the paint and causes it to glow. These paints are less common due to safety concerns. Light-charged substance luminous paints, on the other hand, store light energy when exposed to light sources and gradually release it in the form of a glow. They are widely used in various applications as they are considered safer and more environmentally friendly.</p></p>
