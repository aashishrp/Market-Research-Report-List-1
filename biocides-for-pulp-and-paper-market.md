<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biocides for Pulp and Paper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oxidizing</li><li>Non-Oxidizing</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Biocides are chemicals used in the pulp and paper industry to prevent the growth of microorganisms that can cause deterioration. Oxidizing biocides act by releasing oxygen to disrupt the cellular functions of bacteria and fungi. They are highly effective but may also lead to higher chemical consumption. Non-oxidizing biocides, on the other hand, work by penetrating the cells of microorganisms, inhibiting their growth and reproduction. This type of biocide offers longer residual activity and typically requires lower dosage rates compared to oxidizing biocides.</p></p>
