<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lubricity Improver Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Acidic Lubricity Improver</li><li>Non-Acidic Lubricity Improver</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The lubricity improver market can be categorized into two types: acidic lubricity improvers and non-acidic lubricity improvers. Acidic lubricity improvers are chemicals that contain acids which help reduce friction by forming a protective film on metal surfaces. Non-acidic lubricity improvers, on the other hand, do not contain acids and work by forming a barrier between metal surfaces, reducing wear and tear. Both types of lubricity improvers are used in various industries to enhance the performance and longevity of machinery and equipment.</p></p>
