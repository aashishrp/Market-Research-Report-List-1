<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Foaming Agents for Gypsum Boards Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stable Foaming Agents</li><li>Unstable Foaming Agents</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Foaming agents are utilized in the production of gypsum boards to enhance their properties. Stable foaming agents maintain their effectiveness over time, keeping the foaming process consistent throughout the manufacturing process. They contribute to the formation of a uniform and stable foam structure in the gypsum boards. On the other hand, unstable foaming agents are temporary and less consistent, leading to irregular foam formation. These agents may lose their effectiveness during the production process, resulting in uneven foam structures in the gypsum boards.</p></p>
